    "\n",
    "*Classification and regression are both types of supervised learning used in machine learning, where the goal is to train a model on labeled data to make predictions. The key difference lies in the type of output they produce: classification predicts discrete categories or class labels (such as 'spam' or 'not spam'), while regression predicts continuous numerical values (such as house prices or temperatures). Despite this difference, both approaches follow the same underlying process - learning a mapping from input features to an output - and use similar algorithms that are adapted to suit either categorical or continuous prediction tasks.*\n",

    "# What is a Support Vector Machine?\n",
    "\n",
    "*A Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. In this project, the focus will be on **classification**, not regression.*\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Works:\n",
    "\n",
    "SVM works by plotting data points in a multi-dimensional space, where each feature represents one axis (or dimension).  \n",
    "- For example: a dataset with two features like **height** and **weight** can be visualized in a 2D space.  \n",
    "- A dataset with three features would be 3D, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "The SVM algorithm then attempts to find the **best hyperplane** that separates the different classes of data. A hyperplane is a decision boundary:\n",
    "- In **2D**, it’s a line (1D hyperplane).\n",
    "- In **3D**, it’s a plane (2D hyperplane).\n",
    "- In general, the hyperplane is always **one dimension less** than the feature space.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key question is: **where should the hyperplane be placed?**\n",
    "\n",
    "SVM answers this by choosing the hyperplane that **maximizes the margin** — the distance between the hyperplane and the **nearest data points** from each class (called **support vectors**). This helps improve generalization to new data and makes SVM robust. The margin would be the distance between the hyperplane and the dotted line below.\n",
    "<p align=\"center\">\n",
    "  <img src=\"margin.png\" alt=\"margin\" width=\"300\"/>\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Margins\n",
    "*Hard Margin: No misclassifications allowed; assumes data is perfectly separable*\n",
    "\n",
    "*Soft Margin: Allows some misclassification; better for real-world noisy data*\n"
