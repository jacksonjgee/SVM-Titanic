# Titanic - SVM Machine Learning Project

This project aims to build a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to predict passenger survival on the Titanic dataset. 

This is a project for my university's (UWA) AI club where the task is that each member creates a model using different ML/DL model tpyes. In this case I was given the support vector machine. In this way we can combine different techniques that we used to optimized our own model in a final combined model that will submitted on a Kaggle.com competition https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic

## Project Goals

- Load and explore Titanic dataset
- Preprocess data (handle missing values, encode categories)
- Understand the inner workings of a SVM and how to optimize it.
- Train an SVM classifier
- Evaluate accuracy and performance

## Tools & Libraries

- Python 3.13
- JupyterLab
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (optional for visualization)
