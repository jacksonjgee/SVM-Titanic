# Titanic - SVM Machine Learning Project

This project aims to build a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to predict passenger survival on the Titanic dataset. 

This is a project for my university's (UWA) AI club where the task is that each member creates a model using different ML/DL model types. In this case I was given the support vector machine. In this way we can combine different techniques that we used to optimized our own model in a final combined model that will submitted on a Kaggle.com competition https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic.

I will be mainly using jupyter for my coding but I will pair this with kaggle notebooks as it has the feature of using a cloud accelerator which will drastically improve training time. I will do this by simply copy-pasting the code from jupyter to kaggle notebooks, however the code is written by me (no vide coding).

## Tools & Libraries

- Python 3.13
- JupyterLab
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (optional for visualization)

## Version 2
I have restarted this project, and I want to do things better. I want to conduct this model with a full Data Science life cycle workflow.
This includes understanding the problem and and assumption, then collecting and preprocessing the data, then train/model/validate the model, then launching the model, then maintaining the model. For this project I will just be doing steps 2-3.
